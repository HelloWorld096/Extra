   * Support Vector Machines (SVMs): Finds an optimal hyperplane to separate data classes, maximizing the margin. This is a geometric problem of finding distances and normal vectors.
   * Neural Networks: While many activation functions are non-trigonometric (ReLU, sigmoid), understanding how data is transformed through layers involves rotations, scaling, and translations in high-dimensional spaces. Sometimes, sinusoidal activation functions are used in specific architectures (e.g., positional encodings in Transformers).
   * Spherical Trigonometry: For geospatial data analysis, dealing with points on the surface of a sphere (latitude, longitude) requires specific formulas derived from spherical geometry, which is a direct application of trigonometry.

* Problem Solving: Mathematics is learned by doing. Solve a lot of problems. Don't just read solutions.
* Proof vs. Application: For foundational trig, focus on understanding and applying. For identities, focus on proving. For advanced topics, balance understanding the theory with practical implementation.
* Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib): As you progress into calculus and data science, start implementing these concepts in Python. This will solidify your understanding and show you their practical utility.
   * Use NumPy for array operations, np.sin(), np.cos(), np.dot().
   * Use SciPy for signal processing (scipy.signal) or optimization (scipy.optimize).
   * Use Matplotlib to visualize functions, signals, and transformations.
* Connect the Dots: Always try to see how new concepts relate to what you've already learned. For instance, how does the derivative of sinx relate to its graph? How does FFT connect to the idea of decomposing waves?
